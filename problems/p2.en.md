## Problem 2: The Perfect Tiling Project - 20 pts

### Story Background

You are an interior designer who wants to tile a rectangular room with square tiles without cutting them. To maximize the tile size, you need to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the length and width. This is also an application of the famous Euclidean Algorithm!

### Euclidean Algorithm

This is an efficient algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers. Its core idea is based on the following recursive relation:

$$
\text{gcd}(a, b) = \begin{cases} 
      a & \text{if } b = 0 \\
      \text{gcd}(b, a \% b) & \text{if } b > 0 
\end{cases}
$$

**Operation Example**: Calculate `gcd(48, 18)`

1. `48 % 18 = 12` $\rightarrow$ Convert to finding `gcd(18, 12)`
2. `18 % 12 = 6` $\rightarrow$ Convert to finding `gcd(12, 6)`
3. `12 % 6 = 0` $\rightarrow$ Convert to finding `gcd(6, 0)`
4. When the second number is 0, the first number `6` is the result.

### Problem Description

Read two integers `a` and `b`, calculate and print their greatest common divisor.

**Requirements:**

1. **Must** implement and use the recursive function:
    - `int gcd(int a, int b)`: Returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.
2. **Restrictions:** This problem **strictly prohibits the use of any loops** (for, while, do-while). Violations will result in no points. TAs will check keywords.

### Input Format

A single line containing two integers: `a b` (a, b > 0)

### Output Format

A single line: The GCD of `a` and `b`
