## Problem 3: Cracking the Mathematician's Puzzle - 30 pts

### Story Background

The famous Goldbach's Conjecture proposes: "Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes". For example $4 = 2+2$, $6 = 3+3$, $8 = 3+5$. To verify this conjecture, we need a program to find these two primes!

### Problem Description

Read an even integer `n`, find two primes `a` and `b` such that `a + b = n`.

To find this solution, you need to iterate through all possible combinations and check if `i` and `n-i` are **both** prime.

**Requirements:**

1. To avoid writing the prime checking logic twice inside a loop, you **must** implement and use a pure function:
    - `bool isPrime(int n)`: Returns whether `n` is a prime number.
2. **Restrictions:** Do not use Arrays or `vector` to create a Sieve of Eratosthenes. Please verify primality directly via loops inside the `isPrime` function.

### Input Format

A single line containing an even integer: `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000)

### Output Format

A single line: Two primes `a` and `b`, separated by a space, such that `a + b = n` and `a ≤ b`.

If there are multiple solutions, output the one where `a` is minimized.

### Example

**Sample Input 1**

```jsx
10
```

**Sample Output 1**

```jsx
3 7
```

**Sample Input 2**

```jsx
100
```

**Sample Output 2**

```jsx
3 97
```

### Hint

- You only need to check up to `n/2`.
