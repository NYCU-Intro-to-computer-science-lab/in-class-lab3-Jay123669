## Problem 5: The Cursed Line - Bonus +20 pts

### Story Background

A new chapter in the Legend of the Tower of Hanoi. Brahma's three diamond pillars (1, 2, 3) are arranged in a straight line, but a spatial rift has appeared between pillar 1 and pillar 3 due to the great distance, causing **disks to be unable to teleport directly between 1 and 3**. This means all moves must pass through the middle pillar 2. In other words, you can only perform $1 \leftrightarrow 2$ or $2 \leftrightarrow 3$ moves; direct $1 \leftrightarrow 3$ moves are strictly forbidden.

### Problem Description

Read an integer `n`, print the complete steps to move `n` disks from **Pillar 1** to **Pillar 3**.

**Requirements:**

1. **Must** implement and use the recursive function:
    - `void hanoi(int n, int from, int to, int aux)`
2. **Restrictions:**
    - **Strictly prohibit** moving disks directly from 1 to 3 (or 3 to 1).
    - **Strictly prohibit the use of any loops**.

### Input Format

A single line containing an integer: `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 6)

*Note: Since the number of moves grows much faster than the original (3^n - 1), the upper limit of n is smaller.*

### Output Format

Output one line for each move in the format: `Move disk [ID] from [Source] to [Target]`

### Example

**Sample Input 1**

```jsx
1
```

**Sample Output 1**

```jsx
Move disk 1 from 1 to 2
Move disk 1 from 2 to 3
```

**Sample Input 2**

```jsx
2
```

**Sample Output 2**

```jsx
Move disk 1 from 1 to 2
Move disk 1 from 2 to 3
Move disk 2 from 1 to 2
Move disk 1 from 3 to 2
Move disk 1 from 2 to 1
Move disk 2 from 2 to 3
Move disk 1 from 1 to 2
Move disk 1 from 2 to 3
```
