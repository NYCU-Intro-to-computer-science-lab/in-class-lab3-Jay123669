## Problem 1: The Tower Architect - 20 pts

### Story Background

Your math teacher not only wants to know how many ways 5 people can line up (Factorial), but also wants to know if stacking blocks, with 1 block on the 1st layer, 2 on the 2nd... and 5 on the 5th, how many blocks are needed in total (Summation). Please write a program to calculate both values!

### Problem Description

Read an integer `n`, calculate and print:

1. **Factorial**: $n! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \dots \times n$
2. **Summation**: $Sum(n) = 1 + 2 + \dots + n$

**Requirements:**

1. **Must** implement and use the following two recursive functions:
    - `long long factorial(int n)`: Calculates factorial.
    - `long long sum(int n)`: Calculates summation.
2. **Restrictions:** This problem **strictly prohibits the use of any loops** (for, while, do-while). Violations will result in no points. TAs will check keywords.

### Input Format

A single line containing an integer: `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 20)

### Output Format

First line: Result of `n!`

Second line: Result of `Sum(n)`

### Example

**Sample Input 1**

```jsx
5
```

**Sample Output 1**

```jsx
120
15
```

**Sample Input 2**

```jsx
0
```

**Sample Output 2**

```jsx
1
0
```

### Hint

- Note that when `n=20`, the factorial result exceeds the range of `int`, please use `long long`.
